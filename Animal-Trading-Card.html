			<p class="funfact">Layers on layers: Bears have thick, layered coats. Bears are certainly big and fluffy, but there's a lot more than meets the eye! </p>

				<li><span>Scientific Name</span>: Ursidae</li>
				<li><span>Are bears mammals or marsupials?</span> Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae.

They're found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.</li>

			<p>Not unlike people, bears can be empathetic, fearful, joyful, playful, social and even altruistic. They're all individuals and have unique personalities. Cubs, as well as older bears, engage in social play and have ritualistic mechanisms to meet strangers and decide if they are friendly or not.</p>
